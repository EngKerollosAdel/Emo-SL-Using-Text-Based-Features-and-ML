If this is the first time you are running this project and Python on your machine, you will need to install Python and the required libraries. Here are the steps to set up your environment:

Download and install Python from the official website: python.org
Make sure to check the option to add Python to your PATH during installation.

Install pip:

pip is the package installer for Python. It should be installed automatically with Python. You can check if pip is installed by running:
pip --version

Install Required Libraries:

Create a requirements.txt file with the following content:
arabic-reshaper
python-bidi
pandas
openpyxl
emoji
joblib

Install the required libraries using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Install Additional Libraries Individually (if needed):

If you need to install libraries individually, use the following commands:
pip install arabic-reshaper
pip install python-bidi
pip install pandas
pip install openpyxl
pip install emoji
pip install joblib

Run your main script:
python main.py

These steps will set up your environment and install all the necessary dependencies to run your project.
